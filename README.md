# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. Decision tree, random forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression models will be explored to classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about Titanic passengers, including characteristics such as age, sex, social class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare paid, among others. The target variable is the indication of whether the passenger survived or not.

## Machine Learning Models

The machine learning models used in this project are as follows:

1. **Decision Tree**: This model creates a decision tree to classify passengers based on the provided characteristics.

2. **Random Forest**: A collection of decision trees that are trained with different subsets of data and combined to improve prediction accuracy.

3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: This model classifies passengers based on the proximity to the nearest neighbors in the feature space.

4. **Logistic Regression**: This model predicts the probability of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on the provided features.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using F1-score and confusion matrixes.

## Implementation

The project was implemented in R.
